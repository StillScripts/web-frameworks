# Web Frameworks

A collection of simple components in each of the leading frontend web frameworks. So far, covering React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Qwik and Astro. The components are inspired by the examples provided by Svelte in their [playground]( https://svelte.dev/examples/hello-world).

The examples include the following basic use cases:
 - Hello World
 - Styling
 - Nesting Components
 - Passing Props
 - Basic Variables
 - Dependent Variables (updated when other values changes)
 - Conditional Rendering
 - List Looping

I'm a Next.js web developer open to exploring other libraries and frameworks to use for building web apps. I'll eventually be journaling my experience with exploring each framework in a blog.
